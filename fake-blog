        <h1>Diana's Fake Blog</h1>
        <h2>Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
        <p>I am an attorney turned travel blogger from Chicago (and soon to be full stack developer)! You can check out my blog 
            <a href = "www.mvmtblog.com">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Did you know I attended eight different schools between K-12? Prior to living in Chicago, I've lived in quite a few other places. Here is a list of some of the places I've lived in, starting from the most recent place I've lived in prior to Chicago:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ann Arbor, MI</li>
                <li>Troy, MI</li>
                <li>Farmington Hills, MI</li>
                <li>Harrisburg, PA</li>
                <li>Hattiesburg, MS</li>
                <li>Nanjing, China</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Here, I'll break it down for you even further so you know exactly which years I lived in which cities and for which length of time:</p>
